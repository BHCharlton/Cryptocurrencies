While all machine learning use algorithms to build a model based on provided sample datasets, unsupervised learning differs from supervised learning in that it uses unlabeled data that the algorithm interprets by extracting features and patterns to create a model on its own. In contrast, supervised learning models use algorithms that learn on a labeled dataset as a means for predicting the outcomes of similar datasets in the future. In other words, supervised learning is most effective for those cases where we know the input as well as the corresponding output, whereas unsupervised learning is used when we have the input data but lack any corresponding output.
